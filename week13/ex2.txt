Prevention
Programs using this method will try to avoid ever entering any one of 4 conditions for deadlock (mutual exclusion, hold and wait, no preemption, circular wait). This approache is at least possible.

Avoidance
This strategy is impossible to implement practically because we should know information in advance.

Recovery
(Recovery through preemption) It is highly dependent on the nature of the resource.
(Recovery through rollBack) It is time and space consuming.
(Recovery through killing processes) This method is the simplest way of deadlock recovery but it can cause problems with processes being rerunable.
